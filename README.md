## Project Overview
This repository contains the Database Management System (DBMS) assignment for Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College. The assignment focuses on designing and implementing relational databases, writing SQL queries, and performing data manipulation and retrieval using SQL.

## Assignment Details
- **Subject:** Database Management System (DBMS)
- **Institution:** Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College
- **Course:** B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering OR Information Technology
- **Instructor:** Dr. Subhash Barman and Sombhunath Patyanayak Sir.
- **Semester:** [Could be any from 3rd to 6th]

### Objectives
- To design an Entity-Relationship (ER) model for a given problem statement.
- To convert the ER diagram into a relational schema.
- To implement the schema using SQL and create the necessary tables.
- To write SQL queries for data insertion, updating, and deletion.
- To execute complex queries for data retrieval, aggregation, and join operations.
- To ensure data integrity using constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints.

## Technologies Used
- **Database Management System:** MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **Programming Language:** SQL
- **IDE:** MySQL Workbench, MySQL Shell, or any other SQL editor

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/spexcher/JGEC_DBMS_LAB.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd JGEC_DBMS_LAB
    ```
3. Open your SQL IDE (MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, etc.).
4. Import the SQL script provided in the repository (`file.sql`):
    ```bash
    source path_to_sql_file/file.sql
    ```
5. Execute the SQL script to create the tables and insert sample data.
6. Write and execute the required queries for the assignment.

## ER Diagram
The ER diagram visually represents the relationships between different entities in the database. You can view the ER diagram in the `ER_Diagram.png` file included in the repository.

## Features
- **Table Creation:** Creating tables with appropriate data types and constraints.
- **Data Manipulation:** Insertion, deletion, and updating of records.
- **Queries:** Implementation of basic to advanced SQL queries for data retrieval, including:
  - Select Queries
  - Aggregate Functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)
  - JOIN Operations (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN)
  - Subqueries and Nested Queries
  - Grouping and Sorting
